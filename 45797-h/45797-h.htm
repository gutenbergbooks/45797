<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the important historic events of the
present century is the revolution which took
place in Portugal on the third day of October,
1910, when King Manuel II lost his throne.
The king and his mother were exiled and fled
from Lisbon, the capital city, to England. A
republic was proclaimed throughout Portugal,
and a new, progressive government was adopted
on December 1st, 1910.</p>

<p>Portugal is often described as "a garden by
the side of the sea." Its strength as a country
lies in its agriculture, especially in its vineyards,
which are the chief source of wealth.</p>

<p>Education in Portugal has generally been at
a low ebb. At the time of the revolution less
than one-fifth of the Portuguese people could
read and write. Plans for the new government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
include the opening of many primary schools
and the development of a system of higher education.</p>

<p>The Portuguese are an earnest people, enthusiastic
yet serious-minded. Even the children
play soberly. Whether rich or poor, Portuguese
children are taught to respect age as well
as to honor their parents. Throughout the country
even a small boy takes off his cap and makes
a bow when he meets an older person. Little
girls also are taught gentleness of manner. The
home life is simple and happy.</p>

Our Little Portuguese Cousin</div>



<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<small>Jose's secret</small></h2>

<div class='poem'>
"The childhood shows the man."&mdash;<i>John Milton.</i><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A slim</span> slip of a boy, with dark brown eyes
and pale olive skin, walked at the head of a pair
of fawn-colored oxen as he turned homeward
from the market-place of a small village in the
north of Portugal.</p>

<p>The village was just a humble collection of
narrow streets paved with round, worn cobble
stones; a few shops and a long, one-storied inn;
a group of cottages and two or three larger
houses, and a little white granite church.</p>

<p>Along the street through which Jose Almaida<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
passed with the oxen, the market-day produce
was spread out under the trees. There were
great piles of maize-cobs, potatoes, chestnuts
and beans; baskets full of grapes, figs and
apples; strings of garlic and onions; heaps of
giant early yellow gourds, scarlet pimentos and
deep red tomatoes; panniers of fish, fresh and
salted, and red earthenware household dishes,
crocks and water-jars.</p>

<p>Jose had exchanged the grapes, onions and
tomatoes, which he had brought from the home
farm, for a small amount of tea and of hard,
brown salted codfish,&mdash;now the only luxuries
of the Almaida family. In the rough ox-cart,
Carlos, his dog, a thick-nosed pointer, white
with brown spots, mounted guard over these
provisions.</p>

<p>The market-place was no new sight to Jose.
He did not stop in passing along the street,
except at the village fountain to fill a jar with
water for an old woman. Around the fountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
good-natured looking groups of women were
talking over village affairs,&mdash;women in peasant
dress of dark, full short skirts, bright-colored
waists, and gay red, blue or orange kerchiefs
over their shoulders and hanging from
under their round pork-pie black hats. Each
woman carried a boat-shaped basket or a water-jar
upon her head.</p>

<p>Little Jose was a familiar figure on the market-day.
For five months past, he had done
the family marketing, sometimes with his oldest
sister Joanna as companion, but often, as
to-day, alone. At each greeting, he bowed
and pulled off his long black knitted stocking-cap.</p>

<p>To-day, early in October, the market-place
had confused him. He had heard groups of
men saying that the king had gone away from
the country, never to return, and that there
would be great changes in Portugal.</p>

<p>Jose had three miles to travel before dark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
There was no time to lose, so he urged on the
oxen. But every now and then, out on the main
road, he turned to look back toward the village,
shading his eyes with his hand. Not seeing
what he sought, he urged on the oxen again
with the goad, which was twice as long as himself.</p>

<p>The road was steep. The oxen plodded on
with low-bowed heads. They were small and
intelligent-looking oxen with strong shoulders
and wide-branched horns. Above their heavy
yoke rose the <i>canga</i>, or head-board, the pride of
the Portuguese farmer. This was a piece of
hard wood, about eighteen inches high and five
feet wide, and handsomely carved in open work.
It was the same kind of head-board used by the
Romans two thousand years ago, when they held
control of Portugal.</p>

<p>The up-hill road had many sharp stones. But
the boy's hardened bare feet heeded them not.
Carlos jumped from the cart to run by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
master's side. Jose gave the dog a loving pat:
"Ah, Carlos, brother Antonio does not come
yet."</p>

<p>The dog was the only one who knew Jose's
secret. He looked up with eyes which seemed
full of sympathy, and put his nose into the boy's
hand.</p>

<p>Along the wayside were rows and rows of
oaks, chestnuts, planes, and most of all, white
poplars. The poplars were covered to the top
by trailing vines, loaded with purple grapes. On
the hillsides were scattered little cottages, whitewashed
or painted pale blue, pink, or buff, with
red-tiled roofs. Every cottage which Jose
passed had its shady porch built with trellis
covering, and heavy bunches of grapes hung
over the heads of women spinning at the open
doorways, surrounded by quiet, bare-foot children.</p>

<p>In the distance stood green pine-covered hills.
Farther away rose vast mountains, peak upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
peak, purple now in the shadows of the October
afternoon.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful, mountainous country, this
Minho region around Guimarães, the old capital
city. Minho is Portugal's richest province.
And here, it is said, faces are brighter and
manners gentler than anywhere else in Portugal.</p>

<p>Up-hill the road wound always. Jose met
many other boys, barefooted like himself, but
usually older, driving oxen or pannier-loaded
donkeys. The boys were dressed, as he was, in
loose white linen shirt and blue cotton trousers
which came just to the knees, a scarlet sash
wound three times around the waist, a long,
knitted black cap, and a jacket of brown homespun
slung upon one shoulder. Sometimes the
cap was red or green, but oftenest black; and it
ended in a tassel which hung down the back.</p>

<p>Many a bare-foot girl, too, trudged along
the road, dressed in peasant costume, and driving
a donkey with a short stick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>With a last wistful look in the direction of
the village, Jose turned the oxen from the main
road into the rough wooded lane which led to
his father's home. The ox-cart creaked and
rumbled over the uneven ground. Like all such
carts in Portugal, it was made of four or five
boards laid flat and resting upon two supports.
It had two wheels of solid wood, without spokes,
and with iron tires, fixed fast to an axle which
turned with the wheels. Long as the three mile
journey was to Jose, it was easier to walk than
to ride in the jolting car.</p>

<p>Jose felt very tired. Although it was almost
sunset time, he stopped the oxen and threw himself
down near a clump of fragrant shrubs to
rest before the last half mile of the hard journey.
Carlos came and licked his master's face, then
darted off after a red-legged partridge.</p>

<p>Upon this young boy had fallen the man's
duty in a family of six, including himself,&mdash;a
now helpless father, a hard-working mother, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
three sisters. Since May, when the Senhor
Almaida had a stroke of paralysis, Jose had
done the heavy work&mdash;for a young boy&mdash;of
caring for the oxen, the cow, the chickens and
pig. Besides, he had done what he could, with
the help of Joanna, the seventeen-year-old
sister, to carry on the farm garden and the vineyard.</p>

<p>There was an elder brother, Antonio, now
twenty-one years old. He had left home, four
years ago, to seek his fortune in America. It
was this elder brother whom Jose had been
eagerly looking for during the last four months.</p>

<p>Joanna had at once written to Antonio of the
father's illness, but had not suggested Antonio's
return. "We must not send for Antonio," she
and her mother decided. Three times each
year they had received money from this elder
brother; and the money would be even a greater
help now that the father could not work.</p>

<p>Jose had been given the letter to post on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
village market-day. It was then that the plan
for his secret came to him. At the <i>correio</i>, post-office,
he spent all the money he had ever owned
for a post-card and stamp,&mdash;twenty <i>reas</i>, two
cents, for the card and twenty <i>reas</i> more, for
a two-cent stamp. On one side of the card
he copied in printed letters, Antonio's American
address; on the other side he wrote the
words: "Please come home. We need you.
Jose."</p>

<p>How glad the boy was then that in the evenings
last winter his father had taught him to
write and to spell,&mdash;something which very few
Portuguese children know.</p>

<p>For a long time after mailing the post-card
Jose felt very guilty with the heavy burden of
his secret. As days and weeks went by, the
burden grew lighter, but the desire for Antonio's
return grew stronger.</p>

<p>No letter had come from Antonio since
Joanna had written. No money had come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
either. This fact, which caused anxiety to the
elders, gave Jose strong hope. He felt that
Antonio's not sending any money meant that
Antonio himself was coming.</p>

<small>THE ELDER BROTHER</small></h2>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> few moments of rest in the sweet, cool
air refreshed Jose. He jumped up quickly. The
farm-work must be done before nightfall.</p>

<p>Carlos was barking excitedly. Had he caught
the red-legged partridge? Jose turned to see.
No, the dog was running toward a stranger,
who was walking rapidly in their direction.</p>

<p>Could it be Antonio? Jose's heart-beats
almost choked him. But no; this was a well-dressed
stranger, with shoes on. He was
evidently a man from the city, and a traveller,
too, because he carried a hand-bag. And he had
a black moustache. Of course it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Antonio. Antonio would be barefooted;
Antonio had no moustache.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 356px;">

<div class="caption">"JOSE CALLED TO THE DOG TO LEAVE OFF BARKING."</div>
</div>

<p>Jose called to the dog to leave off barking.
The stranger drew near. Stopping, he stroked
one of the fawn-brown oxen. He looked at
Jose with piercing dark eyes. His olive skin
was clear and sunburned.</p>

<p>"Do you live near here, boy?"</p>

<p>Jose pulled off his cap as he answered:</p>

<p>"<i>Sim, Senhor</i>&mdash;Yes, sir&mdash;a half mile
away."</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Jose Almaida, <i>Senhor</i>."</p>

<p>The stranger dropped his hand-bag. He
waited a moment to control his voice before he
said: "Jose,&mdash;this is your brother Antonio."</p>

<p>The two brothers rushed into each other's
arms and kissed each the other on the cheek.</p>

<p>"<i>Accolade!</i>"&mdash;Welcome! Jose cried out
at last. Antonio, thumping him gently on the
shoulders, had drawn back to look into his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it truly you, Antonio? You are so
changed&mdash;so old&mdash;so splendidly dressed!"</p>

<p>"It is your brother Antonio. You, too, are
so changed, Jose, that I did not know you. Instead
of a very small boy I find a tall, grown lad.
How are the father and mother, and the sisters?
One little sister, Tareja, I have never seen."</p>

<p>Eager talk followed, questions and answers
coming close together. The mild-eyed oxen
looked around as if to ask the reason why the
homeward journey was so long delayed.</p>

<p>"You say the father can never walk again?"
Antonio asked sadly.</p>

<p>"We have had the doctor once. He said
father may perhaps have the use of his right
hand and foot sometime, if he has the best of
care."</p>

<p>"Are there any crops on the farm this year?
Who could do the work?"</p>

<p>"The apple and fig trees have borne well.
We have good crops of maize and melons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
gourds, because father had done the early spring
planting before his illness came. Joanna and
I did the hoeing and took what care we could.
The vines are full of grapes. Father had pruned
and trimmed them last winter. Joanna and
I are gathering the grapes nowadays and
beginning to press them. And I sold some
to-day."</p>

<p>"Is this your dog, Jose?" Antonio asked.
Carlos had burst out again into barking.</p>

<p>"Yes. Inez Castillo, the daughter of Senhor
Castillo&mdash;you remember our neighbor who
lives on the big farm?&mdash;gave Carlos to me
when he was a puppy, a year ago. He stays
with me always when I work and goes with me
wherever I go. He barks in such a friendly way
at you that I think he must know you belong to
the family."</p>

<p>One of the oxen gave a low cry which the
other echoed.</p>

<p>Jose picked up the ox-goad and started them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
forward. "It is time to go on; the night work
must be done."</p>

<p>Antonio lifted his hand-bag into the cart.
"Who does that work?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I do. Sometimes Joanna helps. You will
help now? You have come to stay at home?"
Jose's voice was very wistful.</p>

<p>"I shall stay a while to help. We will not
talk about this before the others."</p>

<p>"A little while will help. I am growing bigger
every day." Jose drew his slight figure to
its fullest height.</p>

<p>Antonio was silent.</p>

<p>"Did you get my post-card, Antonio?" Jose
asked timidly, after a few moments.</p>

<p>"Yes; that is why I came home, Jose."
Antonio threw his arm lovingly over the little
brother's shoulder as they walked on, side by
side.</p>

<p>"Please, oh please, do not speak about it
before the others,&mdash;about my writing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
you," Jose begged in a half frightened
voice.</p>

<p>"I will not speak about it, Jose, I promise
you." Antonio looked down at his brother,
whom he remembered as little more than a baby.
It was hard to realize that this mere child had
been the head of the family for five months.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<small>A PORTUGUESE HOME</small></h2>

<div class='poem'>
"He was a man of single countenance,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of frank address and simple faith."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">&mdash;<i>Francisco de Sá de Miranda.</i></span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was twilight when Antonio, Jose, the
patient oxen and the frisky dog reached home.</p>

<p>Great was the joy over that home-coming.
The father, sitting propped with pillows by the
hearth, put his left hand in blessing upon the
head of his eldest son and exclaimed "<i>Graças
à Deus</i>," thanks be to God. The mother, weeping
tears of joy, held Antonio's strong body in
her arms for a long moment. Joanna, the tall
bronzed sister, who had just come in with the
pails from milking, greeted him with a glad
kiss upon the forehead. Shy, thirteen-year-old
Malfada, her jet black hair floating over her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
shoulders, hugged the big brother, and then ran
to a shadowy corner to watch him. Two-year-old
baby Tareja held out her chubby hands:
Antonio had her on his shoulder now. The
green parrot in its gilded cage cried "<i>Accolade,
accolade</i>," in a shrill tone.</p>

<p>Joanna quickly began preparing for supper
the <i>bôlos de bacalhau</i>&mdash;the Portuguese delicacy
for feast days&mdash;made of minced salt fish, mixed
with garlic, shaped into cakes and fried in olive
oil.</p>

<p>Jose ran out and put the oxen into their corner
of the farm-yard near the house, fed them and
the cow, the chickens and the pig; brought in
firewood, and, last of all, filled the red earthenware
jar with cool water from the well on the
terrace below the garden.</p>

<p>Soon the supper was ready. With thankful
hearts and glad talk the family gathered around
the long, dark, polished chestnut-wood table.
The father's chair was drawn to the side nearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the hearth where a bright fire blazed, lighting
the room. The mother held little Tareja.
Joanna kept the plates filled with <i>bacalhau</i>, with
<i>brôa</i>&mdash;the maize and rye bread of Portugal&mdash;with
the vegetable stew of gourds, dried beans
and rice, flavored with bacon, which was the
usual supper-dish; then, with ripe olives, fresh
figs and sweet seed cakes. Malfada helped the
father take his food. Jose ate hungrily, and
once in a while slipped a piece of <i>brôa</i>, or bacon,
into Carlos' mouth.</p>

<p>The front door stood open. Beyond the
trees, the shadow of twilight lingered in the
valley. The hills were bathed in rosy mist.</p>

<p>The Almaida home was one of the better
class of small farmhouses. It stood in the
centre of a hillside farm of about four acres. It
was a square, plastered stone house, whitewashed
inside and out. The overhanging eaves
of the red-tiled roof were painted deep red underneath.
This was the house where Senhor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Miguel Almaida's father, his grandfather and
great-grandfather had lived.</p>

<p>The central room, into which one entered
from the vine-clad porch, was uncarpeted. The
furnishings showed that the Almaidas were a
family of more than peasant rank.</p>

<p>At one end of the room stood a large cupboard
or cabinet of carved chestnut-wood. Its
shelves were full of odds and ends,&mdash;some old
pieces of English ware, souvenirs of long ago
days when trade relations existed with Great
Britain, and there was a silver platter of the fine
old Portuguese handwork of two hundred years
ago. There were also a few books on the
shelves, and a violin, a guitar and a flute.</p>

<p>Against the wall, opposite the cabinet, were
the beds, separated from one another by
partitions which did not reach quite to the top
of the room.</p>

<p>On the walls hung framed colored pictures of
the Portuguese hero king, Affonso Henriquez,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of Inez de Castro and Prince Pedro, her lover.
A large gilt-framed mirror hung near the door,
and over the mantel was a crucifix.</p>

<p>Never was there a cleaner or a prettier farmhouse
in all Portugal. Never were there better-trained,
more obedient children than Miguel
Almaida's.</p>

<p>The father, in these many days when he had
to sit helpless by the fireside in his arm-chair,
felt grateful for his tidy home, his good wife,
and his dutiful children. He was a man of middle
height, thick-set in figure. He was of grave
character and of great common sense. Even
during this illness he kept himself cheerful and
of good hope.</p>

<p>While the mother strained and cared for the
milk, the older sisters washed and put away the
dishes. Jose sat on a low stool by his father's
side, holding Tareja on his knee, and listening
to Antonio's stories about America, of his
voyage home, and of the revolution in Portugal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Indeed the events in Portugal were of more interest
even than the wonders of far-away
America.</p>

<p>"Our country has changed very little in the
past ten, twenty and perhaps fifty years. Now
we can hope for better times," said Miguel
Almaida.</p>

<p>News of the revolution had been slow in
reaching the hillside farm. What the father
had heard before as rumors Antonio now told
him as facts.</p>

<p>The revolution had taken place while Antonio
was on the voyage from New York to Gibraltar.
The news had greeted him when he landed.
As he had journeyed from Gibraltar to Lisbon,
the capital city of Portugal, and then, northward
still, to Guimarães, people everywhere were
talking of the great event. Since then, travelling
by foot from Guimarães out into the hill
country and past the little market-place, always
the one topic of interest had been King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Manuel's banishment and the fact that the
Portuguese people were now to rule and govern
themselves.</p>

<p>Jose could not understand all that the change
meant. But to Antonio and his father it meant
better times,&mdash;not so much money to be paid in
taxes, better laws, and a chance for the children
to go to school. Almost all of the education
which the Almaida children had received had
been at home. Senhor Almaida was a man
better educated than many of his neighbors.</p>

<p>When the evening work was done, the mother
and the two older sisters drew around the hearth.
Tiny Tareja soon fell asleep in the mother's
arms. Joanna and Malfada began to embroider:
Portuguese girls do beautiful work with their
needles. The hearth-fire of maple wood burned
brilliantly. Two candles on the mantel lighted
up the crucifix.</p>

<p>Every few moments the parrot in its cage
near the mantel, opened its eyes, blinked, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
called out "<i>Accolade! à deus!</i>"&mdash;Welcome!
Good-by! "I am sure the old parrot remembers
you, Antonio," the mother said, each time.
"He has not talked so much as this for six
months."</p>

<p>Now it was that Antonio opened his heavy
travelling-bag. One by one he took out the
presents he had brought. Joanna and Malfada
quickly put aside their work.</p>

<p>First there was a silver watch for the father,&mdash;who
had never before in all his life owned a
watch.</p>

<p>Next came three silver-link hand-bags, the
largest for the mother, the middle sized one for
Joanna, the smallest for Malfada.</p>

<p>When Malfada hung the bag from her round
wrist and held it forth to look at it, Antonio
burst into a hearty laugh and said: "That is
just the way I imagined that Malfada would
dangle the little bag from her wrist."</p>

<p>Antonio put the present for sleeping Tareja<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
into his mother's hands. It was a wonderful
American doll with yellow hair and with eyes
which would shut and open, and it was dressed
all in white, just as Joanna had sometimes, on
rare visits to Guimarães, seen foreign children
dressed.</p>

<p>Then how gleefully they all laughed at the
next present which Antonio brought out! It was
for the house,&mdash;a china salt-cellar, red and
round like a tomato.</p>

<p>"We must put it in the cabinet. It is too fine
to use except on holidays and feast-days," said
the mother.</p>

<p>Jose's present was the last to appear. Now it
was the little boy's turn to receive a paper-covered
package, tied with pink string.</p>

<p>Jose's short fingers trembled in impatience as
he untied the string,&mdash;careful, even in his
haste, not to break it, for a piece of string was
very precious to the boy.</p>

<p>Off came the paper and out came a square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
white box. Off came the box-cover and out
came an engine and four gaily painted cars,&mdash;such
a wonderful toy as Jose had never seen
before.</p>

<p>It was an evening always to be remembered
in the Almaida family. They looked at one
another's presents. They listened to Antonio's
tales of great American cities and railroads and
bridges, of active, rapid-moving people, and of
his own work as foreman on a section of railroad
diggers.</p>

<p>By and by the mother saw that the father, in
his arm-chair, was growing tired. So she told
the children it was time to go to bed, because
they could hear more to-morrow about all these
things.</p>

<p>Jose took the engine and cars, the box and
the pink string to bed with him, and held them
clasped in both hands to make sure that the
treasures were real.</p>

<p>He was very wide-awake. He heard his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
mother and Antonio talking after they had
helped the father to his bed. And the little boy
never forgot Antonio's last words to his mother
that night:</p>

<p>"Before I went away from home, mother,
you said to me 'Each morning, resolve not to
do anything during all the day which will make
you feel sorry when night comes.' I remembered
that each morning, mother, and it kept me
always from wrong ways and wrong places."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>GARDEN AND VINEYARD</small></h2>

<div class='poem'>
"Trees manifold here left their branches tall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fruit laden, fragrant, exquisite and rare."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 16.5em;">&mdash;<i>Camoens.</i></span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span>, the next morning, Jose led Antonio
through the garden and vineyard, crimson vine
leaves and purple grapes were the only signs of
autumn. The green of summer was fresh over
everything else.</p>

<p>The granite gate-posts, which divided the
front yard and flower garden from the fields,
were almost buried in ferns and covered with
ivy. In the garden blossomed roses, bright
geraniums, asters, balsams, verbenas, salvias
and dahlias. The Portuguese are great
lovers of flowers. Their climate, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
temperature hardly ever goes below forty
degrees, is favorable to the growing of all the
flowers, as well as the trees and shrubs, of both
temperate and tropical zones.</p>

<p>On the borders of the Almaidas' garden and
fields, great palms and tall cedars of Lebanon
stood side by side with orange, lemon, citron
and fig-trees. Here and there was an olive-tree,
with gray-green leaves.</p>

<p>"How beautiful the flowers are, Jose, and
how the trees have grown!" Antonio breathed
a happy sigh as he spoke. Many times in his
absence these last four years his heart had cried
out for the flowers and trees and the quiet happiness
of his childhood home.</p>

<p>Jose darted off to the house with the large
bouquet of flowers he had gathered for his
father. As he ran back to Antonio, he called:
"Come to the farm-yard. I want you to see
our pretty, gentle cow, and the chickens and
the pig."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>At the right-hand side of the house was a
good-sized farm-yard, kept more than ankle-deep
in gorse and bracken litter. This yard was
formed by one side of the house and by a small
granite building which held the grape-vats.
High over the yard hung grave-vines on strong
wooden trellises. Here the cattle found shade
and shelter in the heat of mid-summer. In
Portugal, cattle are kept in the yards instead
of being put out to pasture.</p>

<p>The dun-brown cow was indeed a gentle
creature. She leaned her head to one side while
Jose stroked her neck, and she looked at Antonio
with friendly brown eyes. The chickens, in
their corner coop, hurried forward, as if expecting
food, so Jose ran outside the yard and pulled
some handfuls of chickweed for them. The
long, tall pig grunted a welcome, standing still
to have his back scratched. The oxen turned
restlessly, as if wondering why work was so late
in beginning to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Next the brothers visited the grape-vats. The
wide, shallow tubs were full of trodden grapes.
For several days Jose with Joanna, and Malfada
to help sometimes, had carefully removed the
green and decayed grapes from the huge purple
clusters they had gathered, and had thrown the
good grapes into the vats. Jose and the girls
had trodden these grapes with their bare feet.
Now the juice was running from the vats
through the troughs and the strainers in rich
crimson streams into caskets set upon slabs of
granite outside. This is the way that port, the
wine for which Portugal is famed, is made
throughout the country.</p>

<p>Antonio stood looking out over the maize field
and vineyard, of about an acre, beyond the
flower gardens. It was surrounded by poplar
trees. Upon the trees hung grape-vines, heavy
with fruit.</p>

<p>"We must gather more grapes to-day, Jose.
I will help, and together we will tread the wine-press."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Antonio's quick eyes saw that only a
small part of the grapes had been taken from
the vines. They must make the most of the
vineyard crop.</p>

<p>Beyond the grape-vats was the <i>eira</i>, or
threshing-floor, made of granite slabs set close
together, and beyond the <i>eira</i>, a small barn and
storehouse.</p>

<p>The <i>eira</i> was well open to sun and wind. Piled
high at one side were stacks of maize-stalks, full
of unhusked ears. The farm-work was behindhand
at this harvest time: it had been more
than Jose and his two sisters could do. Yet they
had bravely tried.</p>

<p>The oxen's inquiring looks had reminded Jose
that the day's watering of the gardens and fields
ought to begin.</p>

<p>"Let me take the oxen out to-day, Antonio,
please," Jose said, when his brother would have
gone ahead with the work. Jose knew that his
part as leader would soon be ended. Hard as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the care had been, he felt more than half sorry
to give it up to Antonio.</p>

<p>The obedient oxen came forth under the yoke
and the high, carved head-board. With the
long ox-goad Jose guided them, Antonio following,
to the wide terrace at the left side of the
house, where a well was sunk into a deep spring,
which had a supply of water that never failed.
Jose fastened the oxen to the <i>nora</i>, the old-time
water-wheel.</p>

<p>Round and round the oxen went, in a wide
circle, under trellises covered with vines. Their
moving carried power to an endless chain which
was set a few feet apart with buckets. These
buckets, sent dipping in turn down into the well,
brought up water from its depths. Half of it
was spilled by the way. But enough was
saved to make a plentiful stream which
flowed off to the thirsty gardens and fields
below.</p>

<p>In this Portuguese part of Europe there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
scarcely any rain from May to November.
Therefore through the long dry season, watering
is necessary to the growth of the crops and
the vines. Irrigation by the water of springs
brought down from the hill-tops to the farms on
the way, is increasing every year. But many
farmers, in remote places, like the Almaidas',
still follow the two thousand year old custom
of watering from a well by means of the oxen's
turning of the endless chain.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/i0050.jpg" width="346" height="500" alt="Girl walking with basket on head" />
<div class="caption">"JOANNA, WITH A BOAT-SHAPED BASKET OF CLOTHES UPON HER HEAD."</div>
</div>

<p>"This is water enough for to-day," Jose said
at last. "Will you drive the oxen to the
yard? I must help Joanna." And off the boy
ran.</p>

<p>Joanna, with a boat-shaped basket of clothes
upon her head, had just gone to the stream
beyond the barn, near the wood-lane entrance
to the farm. She waded out into the stream,
above her ankles, and took the clothes which
Jose handed to her, washing out one piece after
another in the running water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>When this task was done, busy Jose hurried
back to join Antonio, who had begun to gather
grapes. For an hour they worked, filling and
emptying other boat-shaped baskets, till the sun
was high overhead.</p>

<p>"We will tread the grapes toward night,
Jose," Antonio said, when Joanna called them
to dinner.</p>

<p>At the noon-day meal they ate <i>brôa</i>&mdash;bread&mdash;dipped
in olive oil, a little dried fish, oranges
and figs.</p>

<p>After dinner, in the heat of the day, Antonio
went out to a rocky corner of the farm and lay
down in the cool shade. Jose brought along his
engine and cars. It was the first chance he had
found to-day to play with them. And until
Antonio grew too sleepy, he told Jose about
real trains and railroads.</p>

<p>Oh, it was good to be free, good to be in the
shade of the trees, to look off over the hills and
dream of the cities and the people beyond!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Antonio fell asleep, thinking these thoughts.
When he awoke, Jose was drawing the train of
cars by the pink string, back and forth. A
far-away strain of music sounded upon the
air.</p>

<p>"Have you learned yet to play the flute or
violin, Jose?" Antonio asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, Antonio, I can play the violin a little."</p>

<p>"Run to the house, bring both violin and
flute. You can play the one, and I will
see if I have forgotten what I knew about the
other."</p>

<p>Away sped Jose. Returning, he gave Antonio
the flute, keeping the violin. Then for an hour
the brothers played, not by note but by ear, the
simple, sweet melodies of the country-side. The
Portuguese people are lovers of music as of
flowers. Each farmer, peasant, shepherd and
charcoal-burner has his guitar or violin, his pipe
or flute.</p>

<p>Jose's violin notes were true and liquid. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
old violin&mdash;it had been his grandfather's&mdash;was
rich-toned. Presently Antonio laid aside
the flute and listened to the little brother's playing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<small>THE HUSKING OF THE MAIZE</small></h2>

<div class='poem'>
"If all the year were playing holidays,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To sport would be as tedious as to work."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">&mdash;<i>William Shakespeare.</i></span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Jose</span> and Antonio, Malfada and Joanna
worked side by side those busy days of the next
two weeks. They gathered and trod the grapes.
They cut and carried through the threshing-floor
great sheaves of maize and of bean-stalks,
leaving them to dry there in readiness for the
threshing. The girls were active and willing,
strong and cheerful. Both girls and boys
worked with the eager purpose of helping the
invalid father and the mother so wearied with
constant care of the sick man and the young
child.</p>

<p>After the grapes were gathered, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
maize and beans harvested, the hard work was
over for a time. The gourds and watermelons,
which had been planted between the rows of
maize and beans, now open to the sunshine, were
gaining in mellow color.</p>

<p>There was some free time for the Almaida
family in the afternoons of these October days.
Jose drew his engine and cars back and forth
on the terrace, Carlos barking after him. Sometimes
Jose played with Malfada around the
water-works, and swam oranges in the streams
still running from the endless chain of buckets.
The mother and Joanna worked in the flower
garden. Antonio wandered off on the hillside
with his flute.</p>

<p>At the maize-husking season in Portugal there
is many a gay assembly. The threshing-floor is
the social gathering-place for old and young.
Antonio, Joanna, Malfada and even little Jose
had already been to the <i>Decamisadas</i>, or husking,
on neighboring farms, when the work and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the dancing had lasted until late into the evening.
Now Antonio had, in turn, invited their neighbors
to a maize-husking.</p>

<p>On the afternoon set, eager troops of men and
boys, most of them carrying some musical instrument,
came in holiday costume of homespun
trousers, white linen shirt with a large gold or
silver stud at the neck, a red sash bound around
the waist, broadcloth or homespun cloak hung
over one shoulder, and newest hat of black felt
or cap of knitted yarn. Eager troops of girls
came also, in full short skirts, in bodices of dark
red or yellow worn over white waists, the large
sleeves newly starched and ironed. Each girl
had a gay-colored cotton or silk kerchief over
her shoulders, and almost every one wore handsome
filigree gold earrings.</p>

<p>Jose's mother was dressed in the same kind
of costume, except that her kerchief was of soft
dark red silk; and she wore her chief treasure,
a heavy gold chain and cross.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>That afternoon, for the first time since his
illness, Senhor Almaida sat out on the porch in
his arm-chair, his best broadcloth cloak wrapped
about him. In the excitement of the family
preparation for the <i>Decamisadas</i>, he had moved
his right hand slightly. How the mother and
the children rejoiced in this sign of returning
strength!</p>

<p>The husking went on merrily. Skilful fingers
made quick work. Gossip and song filled the
air with busy hum. At times one or two of the
men left off work, upon Antonio's asking, and
for a half hour played familiar tunes on flute,
guitar, violin or pipe.</p>

<p>Toward sunset, when the sky was all aglow
with red light, the mother, Joanna and Malfada
brought out the supper of <i>brôa</i>, dried fish and
preserved fruits. The large platters were
piled high with the food, and there was plenty
more in the house. The workers had hearty
appetites, and each took a cupful of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fresh-pressed grape-juice which Antonio passed
around.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i0060.jpg" width="351" height="500" alt="woman dancing" />
<div class="caption">"SHE WAS A PICTURE OF YOUTH, BEAUTY AND GRACE."</div>
</div>

<p>The round harvest moon rose just at sunset.
In the red-silver glow of twilight and moonlight,
the cheerful workers began their tasks
again. After an hour more, the husking was
finished. A huge heap of golden ears gleamed
in the centre of the threshing-floor. Willing
hands carried these off to the barn. The
threshing-floor was cleared of maize-stalks and
chaff. All was ready for dancing.</p>

<p>First the young men and maidens formed a
circle and went round and round in a merry jig.
Then they danced, in groups, the <i>bolero</i>, a dance
slow and firm in motion, with well-marked
time. This was followed by a lively reel.</p>

<p>As the music grew louder, little Jose dared to
join in with his beloved violin.</p>

<p>Then singing burst forth to the music, players
and dancers taking part in the simple country-side
melodies, until, warm and breathless, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
dancers drew back to the edges of the threshing-floor.
And now they began eagerly calling upon
Inez Castillo for the dance she did so well.</p>

<p>Eighteen-year-old Inez Castillo had stood
aside while the others danced. She did not like
so much romping. But now she stepped forward
good-naturedly at their request. Her deep
black eyes glowed with the lustre of health.
There was a ripe red flush upon her cheeks, an
expression of gentle modesty upon face and
figure.</p>

<p>"You play for me, Jose, you alone, please,"
the girl asked. She knew how perfectly in tune
and in time Jose's music was.</p>

<p>Steadily, but rather low at first, the boy began
to play. Steadily and gracefully Inez danced
forth, her silver bracelets tinkling upon her
wrists. Her arms and body moved in perfect
time. She was a picture of youth, beauty and
grace.</p>

<p>Jose did not think about the people listening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
as he drew his bow back and forth. He
thought only of making his music as true as possible
for Inez,&mdash;Inez who had given him his
dear dog-friend Carlos.</p>

<p>Antonio leaned against the stone wall of the
barn, watching the face of his music-loving little
brother. "I must try to let the lad have some
music-training," he said to himself. He
watched, too, the modest, graceful dancing of
Inez; and he decided that however interesting
far-away America had been, his own fatherland
was a goodly country.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>AN AUTUMN RAMBLE</small></h2>

<div class='poem'>
"With dreamful eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My spirit lies</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Under the walls of Paradise."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">&mdash;<i>Thomas Buchanan Read.</i></span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> father was better. He could move the
weak hand and foot, although he was not yet
able to use them. But he could sit all day in the
arm-chair on the porch. From there he was
able to direct the late autumn work. This was
fortunate. Antonio had half forgotten what
needed to be done, and Jose did not yet know
much about it.</p>

<p>The mother's face had brightened. She did
the work of the household and cared for Tareja
with a thankful heart. Joanna and Malfada<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
were again busy all day out of doors in the field
with their brothers.</p>

<p>Now the winter's supply of gourds, left
among the stubble of maize-stalks, had grown
very large and yellow. There were two kinds of
gourds,&mdash;one, smooth and round, the other,
long and striped. These were gathered and
lifted, some to the low roof of the barn, others
to the top of the rocky ledge, where they would
not have to stand in the wet after the autumn
rains began. The melons, also, were gathered
and stored in the same way. Upon these places,
gourds and melons would keep sound until February.
All through the winter the better ones
would be valuable food for the family, while the
coarser ones would be used for cattle and pig.</p>

<p>There was a good supply of cabbage in the
garden for the winter's house-use and for feeding
the live stock. Sown late in the summer,
the cabbage had grown to four or five feet in
height. Its lower leaves would be picked off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
week after week, then the stalks cut down in
the spring to make room for other crops.</p>

<p>Twice Jose went with Antonio to the wild
lands of the remote hillside, and loaded upon
the ox-cart gorse, heather, bracken and wild
grass as winter stabling for the cattle. This
they cut or scraped together with broad-bladed
hoes,&mdash;simple tools made of a flat piece of iron
shaped like a spade and fastened upon a handle.
Jose's hoe-handle was so long that he had very
hard work to manage it. But he bravely
kept on, no matter how his arms and
back ached during those early November
days.</p>

<p>It would soon be time to plough the stubble
and to sow the winter barley, rye and wheat, the
flax, and the maize for cattle feed.</p>

<p>"We will take a holiday, Jose, before we
begin this new work. Where would you like to
go?" Antonio asked, as they walked homeward
from the wild-land by the side of the oxen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Carlos ran ahead on the wood-road, sniffing the
fresh air.</p>

<p>"I would like best to go up to the hill-top,
where we can look off and see Guimarães and
the old ruined Roman city, Citania."</p>

<p>"We will go to-morrow. You have earned a
holiday, and the up-hill walk will straighten
your shoulders. The hoeing has made you bend
over like a little old man."</p>

<p>The next morning's work of caring for the
live-stock was done early. Each with a lunch-basket,
and a cloak hung over one shoulder, the
two brothers set forth, followed by Carlos, and
watched out of sight by the family on the front
porch.</p>

<p>They found the mossy old foot-path which
led from the main road up the hill. Pine needles
made the rocks here and there as slippery as
glass. But tufts of tall, stout grass along the
path served as a help in climbing.</p>

<p>The sky overhead was deepest blue. Through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the trunks of trees on both sides of the path they
could see many a maize-field yellow with stubble,
and many a vineyard with brilliant bronze
leaves.</p>

<p>The trees were very beautiful. Here was the
straight trunk of a eucalyptus "tall as the mast
of some great admiral;" here was a cork-tree
with a rich, brown velvet-like trunk, and here a
gum-tree, its long drooping leaves of russet, red
and orange showing like jewels against the
slender, dark trunk.</p>

<p>There were seats for the weary built against
the trees along the way. Once in a while the
brothers stopped to rest. And at the noon hour
they ate their luncheon, Jose sitting at Antonio's
feet, and giving a large part of his own share
to the dog.</p>

<p>By early afternoon they came to the rocky
crag of the hill. A humble hermitage stood
upon the outer edge of this great rock. Near
the hermitage a gilded cross was built upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
broad pillar of piled stones,&mdash;the work of some
long-ago, shoeless Carmelite or Trappist monk.
The hermitage was deserted now, but the palms
and ferns around it were rich in beauty.
Antonio, who had read much about his country's
history, told Jose that all these green
growing things had been planted and tended
with loving care by the devout monks who had
taken on themselves the vows of poverty and of
silence.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i0070.jpg" width="350" height="500" alt="two boys on hillside" />
<div class="caption">"FOR A LONG TIME THE BROTHERS WERE SILENT."</div>
</div>

<p>Antonio and Jose lay down upon the soft, fine
grass, under a tall palm-tree, and looked out
over the wide view which the rocky crag gave.
The mole-crickets made a soft churr-churring
sound around them. Blackbirds in the tree-tops
gave shrill, crowing calls. From hilly pastures,
shepherds among their sheep sang in rivalry
with one another.</p>

<p>For a long time the brothers were silent. The
beauty of the scene almost took away speech.
On all sides were purple hills and upon every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
hill-top stood a hermitage or shrine with a
shining cross above it. Far away rose the giant
peak of the Penha, a mountain covered with
green up the greater part of its height, then bare
granite to its top.</p>

<p>Antonio pointed to the southeast: "There
on the plain, is Guimarães, with its many roofs
and chimneys; and, look, there is the smoke of
a railroad train."</p>

<p>"Will you take me there some time, Antonio,
so that I can see a real train of cars?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jose, we will go there on our next
long holiday. Now look over yonder. Half
way up the hill do you see some rows of stone
wall?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Antonio."</p>

<p>"There lies the old fortress city, built by the
Romans more than a hundred years before
Christ was born. It is called Citania now, and
it is in ruins. Some day you will read about it
in a book of history."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Jose sighed as he said: "I fear it will be a
long, long time before I can read a book. I can
only spell out a few words now,&mdash;not much
more than I wrote on the post-card to you."</p>

<p>"Would you like to go to school this winter,
Jose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, how I should like it,&mdash;more than anything
else in all the world! But there is no
school, and if there was one, I could not leave
the farm-work to go to it."</p>

<p>"There is to be a free primary school opened
this winter, with a good teacher, in our village
where we go on market-days. I want you to
attend the school, Jose."</p>

<p>"But who will do the work at home, Antonio?
You will soon go back to America, I
think." Jose never forgot, even in the joy of
having Antonio at home, that this big brother
might soon go away again.</p>

<p>Antonio was silent a long time. Then he said
slowly, looking off to the far Penha Mountain:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
"Jose, how would you feel if I told you I will
stay at home?"</p>

<p>"I should be very happy, oh, so happy,
brother."</p>

<p>"Well, Jose, I have decided to stay."</p>

<p>Jose raised himself upon his elbow and looked
eagerly into Antonio's face: "Do you really
mean it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, Jose."</p>

<p>"Then I <i>can</i> go to school, and learn as much
as you know?"</p>

<p>Antonio laughed a little sadly: "It is not very
much that I know, from books. Most of the
small amount I know is what I have learned
from men and things in America, and from the
newspapers. But I will study in the evenings
this winter. I would rather have an education
than be a millionaire. There was a
school in the village when I was your
age. The new school will be better than
that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why will it be better, Antonio?" Jose
asked. He knew nothing of schools except that
they were places where children could learn to
read from books.</p>

<p>"We had old, dull books to study, and we
had to wait, all in one class, until every boy and
every girl had learned the lesson. But Senhor
Castillo has told me that in the new school there
will be new books, and there will be more than
one class, so that the boys and girls who
are quickest to learn can go ahead of the
others."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I shall not be quickest to learn,
Antonio."</p>

<p>"Try as hard as you can, Jose. Then, in
the future, perhaps you will be one of the rulers
of Portugal. The time is coming in this country
when education will mean power."</p>

<p>Jose listened with close attention. And although
he could not understand Antonio's
words, he remembered them. A moment later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
he asked: "May I be the one to tell the family
that you will stay at home with us, Antonio?
I know the father and mother have felt very
anxious about this."</p>

<p>"Yes, Jose, you may tell them this evening.
Now take a last look toward Guimarães. We
must start for home. It is nearly the sunset
hour, and darkness will soon follow. The path
is so steep that we need light to tread it."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>WINTER WORK AND PLAY</small></h2>

<div class='poem'>
"See, winter comes to rule the varied year."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">&mdash;<i>James Thomson.</i></span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">What</span> joy in the home when Jose that evening,
after the late supper, told the good news!
How they crowded around Antonio, clapping
him on the shoulders! With what glee did
Joanna bring out preserved fruits and sweet
cakes for them to eat as they drew their chairs
around the hearth!</p>

<p>"We will have many a happy winter evening
together;" the father spoke with a new courage
shining in his eyes. "The doctor you sent for,
Antonio, came to-day while you and Jose were
away. He told me that if I rest this winter,
free from care, I shall have full use of my right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
hand and foot again. Your taking the care
from me will be what saves me, Antonio."</p>

<p>"I can do more than keep you from care,
father. I saved money while I was away, and
have over two hundred dollars now, even after
paying my passage home. I will spend some of
this money to make the farm better."</p>

<p>This was the first time Antonio had spoken
of his savings. He had kept silent until he
could decide as to whether or not he would go
back to America.</p>

<p>"You are a rich man, my son." A look of
pride shone in the father's eyes as he spoke.</p>

<p>"You deserve it, Antonio. You are a good
son," the mother said, as she wiped happy tears
from her eyes.</p>

<p>Indeed this seemed to the whole family a
very great fortune. Even Senhor Castillo was
not worth more than five hundred dollars, and
he was the wealthiest man for miles around.</p>

<p>"I will buy a new plough and some new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
tools. We shall soon have enough better crops
to more than pay for this spending. When you
are well again, father, there will be two men of
us to work instead of one."</p>

<p>"And what about Jose?" The father put
his left hand upon the little boy's shoulder.
Jose was kneeling beside him, roasting chestnuts
on the hearth.</p>

<p>"I am going to school this winter, Antonio
says." Jose looked up with a happy face.</p>

<p>"A school term will begin early in January,
at the village. Jose can go for the sixteen
weeks; he is strong enough to walk there and
back, I think," said Antonio.</p>

<p>"Sometimes can I go, too?" Malfada asked,
tossing back her thick black hair.</p>

<p>"Yes, little one, you can go with Jose, that
is the best plan. Then you can help each other
with your lessons," the father said quickly.</p>

<p>Soon the winter began. The dull weather
with heavy rains lasted two or three weeks. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
this Portuguese country, autumn meets winter
with pouring rain and with strong winds, which
break down almost everything in the gardens
and which cover gardens and fields with wet
leaves and long sprays of vine.</p>

<p>During these days Antonio and Jose wore
about the farm-work curious coats made of several
layers of dried grass. These were some
protection against rain and wind. But there was
not much work to be done until the heavy
storms should cease.</p>

<p>In late November the sun came forth brightly.
It was time to plough the stubble fields.</p>

<p>The only plough Jose had ever seen until
now, was one made of a crooked branch of hardwood
tree, shod with iron,&mdash;of the same pattern
as the plough used by the Romans two thousand
years ago. It was a plough so light in
weight that after the day's work was done, the
man lifted it from the ground and hung it over
the yoke of the ox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>This old kind of plough was drawn by one
ox, and it stirred the soil only six or seven inches
deep. The new plough&mdash;which Antonio
brought home one day behind the oxen&mdash;turned
a deep straight furrow in the light
crumbling soil.</p>

<p>The old harrow, to level the ground after the
ploughing, was made of fifteen or twenty teeth
of iron set into a wooden framework. The
new harrow which Antonio bought had many
strong, close-set teeth.</p>

<p>Jose had followed after the plough with great
delight, to watch its working. Now, when Antonio
let him ride on the harrow-seat, the boy
kept his head turned back most of the way, in
order that he might see the ploughed land grow
level under the harrow's teeth.</p>

<p>"Surely our crops will be doubled next season&mdash;twice
as large as ever before&mdash;because
the ground is so well-prepared," the father said
each day as he watched the work from the doorway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
He seemed to gain in strength daily,
even during this dullest season of the year. It
was hard, though, for him to be unable to help,
for there was much work to be done.</p>

<p>Jose was given the sowing of the winter wheat
and rye, and of the maize for the winter food
of the cattle. Antonio pruned the grape-vines
and cut off the tops of the trees on which the
vines hung. Soon the maize shot up, and the
young stalks had to be cut, morning and night.</p>

<p>Jose stayed around the house all one market-day
afternoon, taking care of little Tareja and
being company for his father, while the mother,
Joanna and Malfada went to the village with
Antonio. Malfada dangled the silver-link bag
from her wrist, just as Antonio knew she would;
and she brought back home in it a little boxful
of candies for Jose. It was a great day for
them all.</p>

<p>There were long, pleasant evenings, for Portuguese
families stay at home together instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of going to their neighbors for amusement.
Jose played softly on his violin. The mother,
Joanna and Malfada sewed or embroidered.
Antonio read aloud from some book, or oftener
from a newspaper he had bought on the weekly
market-day and which gave news of the nation's
progress. Sometimes, but not often, he
went out with his flute; and then the family
knew that he had gone to serenade Inez Castillo.</p>

<p>Swiftly the days passed. Soon came <i>Natal</i>&mdash;Christmas&mdash;the
great holiday of the year.
On this day and on New Year's, there were
fireworks and decorations at each farmhouse,
singing, and visits back and forth.</p>

<p>Daily between Christmas and New Year's
the Almaida family ate <i>bôlos de bacalhau</i>, and
<i>rebanadas</i>,&mdash;thick slices of <i>brôa</i> soaked in
new milk, fried in olive oil and spread with
honey. <i>Rebanadas</i> is the special holiday food
for Christmas and New Year's. The red tomato<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
salt-cellar was used at table on each of
these days.</p>

<p>The holidays from farm-work lasted up to
the Feast of the Epiphany, January 6<sup>th</sup>. On
the day after, the school in the village opened.</p>

<p>Five days each week Jose and Malfada
walked barefoot the three miles in the early
morning, returning in the dusk of the mild
winter day. The walk was very tiring sometimes.
It was fortunate that both children were
strong, and used to being much on their feet.</p>

<p>At first Carlos wanted to go with them. But
soon he seemed to understand that he was not
to be allowed to take these morning walks. On
each school-day, however, at four o'clock, he
would begin watching for the children, and the
moment he caught sight of them coming along
the wood-lane, he dashed off at top speed to
meet them.</p>

<p>The old parrot was very funny these days.
So much going and coming confused him. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the mornings when Jose and Malfada went
away he called out <i>Accolade</i>&mdash;welcome, and
in the afternoons, when they returned, <i>à deus</i>&mdash;good-by.
These were the only words he
knew; Jose had tried in vain to teach him other
words, just as Antonio had tried when a little
boy.</p>

<p>"The parrot is growing very old; he is losing
his sense," the mother said one day when
the bird greeted the children on their return
from school with <i>à deus! à deus! à deus!</i></p>

<p>"Oh no, mother; I am sure he thinks it is
a joke, just as we do," Jose said, very earnestly.</p>

<p>On the Saturday holiday Jose worked from
dawn till dark, helping Antonio. The vine-pruning
and tying did not end until February.
Jose learned to tie the vine branches skilfully
to the trees, leaving room for the vines to grow
and not be hurt by the cord. In February,
March and April came the sowing for the crops
of the summer and autumn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The sixteen weeks' term of school ended in
April. Jose had been put into the class of the
quickest learners. He had gone rapidly ahead
of Malfada, who, although three years older,
stayed in the lower class.</p>

<p>Jose had been eager over his books,&mdash;far
more eager than Malfada. But he ran almost
all the way home, and reaching there long before
she did, put away his books gladly. The
school-room, with its crowd of boys and girls,
had seemed hot and dusty those days when the
outside world was growing so beautiful.</p>

<p>Antonio was out in the field, planting cabbages,
when Jose hurried toward him calling:
"No more school, Antonio, no more school
now."</p>

<p>Antonio straightened back his shoulders and
asked: "Is this the boy who wanted so much
to go to school?"</p>

<p>Jose's face turned very red under its tan.
But when he saw the teasing look in Antonio's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
eyes, he laughed and said: "It is good to have
spring come after winter, so I think it is good
to change from going to school to not going.
Besides, the teacher says there will be a ten
weeks' term next autumn."</p>

<p>"Spring unlocks the flowers, so the spring
should let children come out of doors," said
Antonio. "There will be some hard work for
you, Jose, but never mind!"</p>

<p>"Never mind," repeated Jose, racing back to
the house with Carlos at his heels.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>WHEN SPRING UNLOCKS THE FLOWERS</small></h2>

<div class='poem'>
"In the merry month of May."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">&mdash;<i>William Shakespeare.</i></span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> hills were sweet with the air of spring.
Down their sides ran rills of water, foaming
with golden light. The fresh grass of the fields
was carpeted with flowers. The young vine-shoots
were full of tender, pale green leaves.</p>

<p>Lemon and orange trees shone with white
blossoms. The elder, lotus, and shining-leaved
magnolia showed almost more white than green.
The pomegranate held forth fiery red blossoms.
The olive-tree, with its stunted growth
and its gray-green leaves, glowed all day long
with a beautiful silver color under the bright
sunshine. In the flower-garden, roses, geraniums
and heliotrope were a-bloom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Crops were growing wonderfully. The effects
of the deep ploughing already showed in
the stronger maize-stalks, the more abundant
bean pods and the well-started vegetables.</p>

<p>"The fourth leaf-spike has appeared on the
maize: it is time for the hoeing," said the
father. He could walk now, slowly, with the
aid of a stout cane, as far as the field.</p>

<p>It was easy for Jose to work with the new
short-handled hoe Antonio had bought for him.
Yet at the end of the day his arms and wrists
were so tired that he could scarcely draw the
bow across the violin. Many an evening the
bow dropped from his hand as he fell asleep,
heavy-eyed after being all day in the open air.</p>

<p>As soon as the young maize-stalks were
strong enough to stand the flow of water, the
oxen were set to work at the <i>nora</i> and streams
of water began running down through the fields.
The dry season had commenced. There was
day after day of bright, unclouded sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the thinning of the crops, to make
the strong stalks grow stronger, and to give
food for the cattle.</p>

<p>Working with his bare feet two or three
inches deep in the warm, moist soil, Jose felt
as if he were a part of this great, growing,
beautiful world. The strength of the earth
seemed to come into him with the air he
breathed. He was taller and more sturdy: he
no longer looked like the slim slip of a boy of
six or seven months ago.</p>

<p>Early in June the crops had grown to their
limit. Their turning to a yellow color showed
the ripening. It would soon be time for cutting
down the first crop of barley, oats, rye and
wheat, and to make ready for a second sowing.
The flax had already been taken up, and had
been steeped or soaked in water for more than
a week. Now, well-dried in the sun, it must be
broken and scutched by hand, or taken to some
mill to be finally made ready for spinning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Antonio decided that he would carry the flax
to Guimarães, where there were good mills, instead
of having his mother and sisters do the
work at home. Besides, he wanted to buy
some new seeds for the second sowing.</p>

<p>"Would you like to take a holiday with me
to-morrow?" he asked Jose on the evening before
St. Antonio's day.</p>

<p>"Yes. Where? To Guimarães?" Jose replied
quickly.</p>

<p>"How did you guess, little brother?"</p>

<p>"Because last autumn, when we went on a
holiday, you said you would take me to Guimarães
when we went away again."</p>

<p>"We will start early to-morrow. We will
take the oxen, because I am going to carry the
flax to the mill."</p>

<p>"It is good to have the holiday on St. Antonio's
day. Because you have that name, the
day should be your holiday, Antonio."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>ON ST. ANTONIO'S DAY</small></h2>

<div class='poem'>
"&mdash;in my soul is naught but gayety."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">&mdash;<i>Antonio Ferreira.</i></span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the first time in all his life, Jose was to
see Guimarães, the old city where Portugal's
hero king, Affonso Henriquez, was born in
1109, the great warrior who made of Portugal
a united country.</p>

<p>On the morning of St. Antonio's day, the
thirteenth of June, the family was up early to
eat with Antonio and Jose the holiday breakfast
of <i>estofado</i>&mdash;stewed meat and vegetables. At
six o'clock they gathered on the wide stone doorstep
to see the brothers start. Carlos lay at the
edge of the step, his nose upon his paws, waiting,
both eyes fixed upon Jose. The dog knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that some unusual journey was planned; he was
all ready to go, too.</p>

<p>But Carlos could not go. This was Jose's
only regret at starting. "He would be frightened
and perhaps lost in the city," Antonio said.
So the dog was held back by Joanna, and he
decided, in his dog way, that Jose must be
going off to school again. The parrot's
cries of <i>Accolade! Accolade!</i> followed the
brothers until they were beyond reach of the
sound.</p>

<p>It was a glorious June morning. Although
so early, the sun was even now high in the blue
heavens. The air was fragrant with sweet
flower perfumes. Many small brown and yellow
butterflies fluttered along the roadside.
Large gray sand-lizards ran out from the underbrush.
Meadow-larks and blackbirds sang
in every tree-top.</p>

<p>All beyond the village market-place was new
to Jose. The road grew constantly better.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Soon above the pine forests appeared the granite
peak of Penha. On the approach to Guimarães,
the ground rises and pine forests spread
around the city for miles. In that wild country,
Affonso Henriquez first learned the art of
war, and in his very boyhood became the trusted
leader of his troops.</p>

<p>As the brothers drew nearer, they saw the
gentle hill on which stand the walls of the old
castle, still keeping watch over the city which
lies beneath. It is impossible to imagine a ruin
more stately than that of this grand old castle
of the Middle Ages, the first Christian fortress
in Portugal,&mdash;a castle-fortress which tells the
story of the strong spirit of the race of men who
built it. The huge granite blocks, each taller
than a man, which form the battlements, still
stand erect and immovable.</p>

<p>On the road, as the brothers drew yet nearer,
were many other travellers, like themselves
bound for the city. It was market-day as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
as the holiday of St. Antonio. There were men
and women, boys and girls, in gala-day costume.
Sometimes the women and girls were driving
donkeys, pannier-laden. But oftenest, these
women-folk had baskets, heavily filled, upon
their heads; in Portugal women carry everything
in baskets, from babies to bales of goods.
There were herdsmen on the way, driving
flocks of goats. Groups of children walked
soberly along with their parents. Now and
then a beggar asked Antonio for a bit of money;
but Portugal has few beggars compared with
its neighboring country, Spain.</p>

<p>The crowd of holiday-makers grew. Jose
climbed into the ox-cart, because he could see
more and because the long walk and the unusual
excitement were making him feel rather tired.
Most of the travellers passed on ahead, for the
oxen, pulling their load up-hill, made slow progress.
But Jose did not mind this. The music
of a brass band was coming to his ears. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
had to ask Antonio what it was; he had never
before heard a band.</p>

<p>Guimarães is a delightful old city. Even
people who have travelled much more than Jose
think so. It is full of picturesque buildings.
There are many houses with balconies and windows
of fine wood-carving. Several of the
streets are hardly more than narrow alleys,
and the eaves of the houses all but meet
overhead. Some of the wider streets end
in wonderful views of the hills, seen across
fields brilliant green with rye and clover. And
there is a beautiful old granite cathedral
church.</p>

<p>Jose had never seen anything so marvellous
as this building. In its graceful granite belfry
tower the peal of eight bells was ringing out
the hour of ten as the oxen moved slowly past,
along the crowded street. But Jose hardly
noticed the people: he was looking up, full of
eager curiosity, at the strange heads and faces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
half like men, half like animals,&mdash;the gargoyles
carved on church and tower.</p>

<p>"Take me to see the cars and the railroad
first of all, please, Antonio," had been Jose's
request, made over and over again that morning
on the way.</p>

<p>So, to please the little brother, Antonio drove
the oxen directly to the railway station. By
good fortune they were just in time to see the
arrival of a long passenger train. Jose was almost
terrified by the rushing in of the tall black
engine with its smoke and noise. The cars, with
their seats and windows and curtains, seemed
to him like strange little homes.</p>

<p>Many a traveller turned to gaze with interest
at the earnest-faced, black-eyed boy and the
handsome, strong-looking brother, with the
fresh color of the country upon their faces.</p>

<p>A little girl dressed in white stepped from
the cars, holding fast to her mother's hand.
"See, Antonio," Jose cried out in a voice so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
loud that everyone around heard: "See, she
looks just like Tareja's doll!" As the mother
and little girl passed, they smiled with friendly
blue eyes at the brothers.</p>

<p>After the passenger train moved out of the
station, a puffing freight engine went back and
forth, shifting and changing about many long,
box-like looking freight cars. Presently the
cars were all in place, and the puffy engine
pulled them slowly away.</p>

<p>Jose would have stayed all day at the station,
waiting for other trains to come and go. His
eyes were not yet satisfied. But Antonio had
many other things to do. When they finally
turned away, Jose looked back as long as
the station remained in sight. He soon,
however, grew interested in seeing other
sights.</p>

<p>To Antonio, Guimarães seemed very old-fashioned
and slow, compared with the busy
American cities of the same size which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
seen. But to Jose everything was new and wonderful,&mdash;so
many people, such tall buildings,
such beautiful things in the shop windows, so
much noise.</p>

<p>Everywhere on the corners of the quaint,
crowded streets groups of men were talking
about the new government, and curious small
boys were listening at the edges of the crowds.
Jose wanted to stop long enough to hear what
was being said; but Antonio urged the oxen on
toward the mill. Processions of young men
marched through the streets to the music of
flutes, pipes, and drums. On many a street the
statue figure of St. Antonio, in a shrine, was
decorated with flowers and garlands of leaves.
Around bonfires in the city square young people
were dancing.</p>

<p>When they reached the mill, Antonio fastened
the oxen at the corner of a near-by side street.
Jose helped carry the flax into the mill, but he
hurried back to take his seat in the ox-cart:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
he liked this better even than staying in the
mill.</p>

<p>A red, whizzing machine which Jose knew at
once, from descriptions Antonio had given him,
was an automobile&mdash;came rushing through the
narrow street. The frightened oxen pulled so
hard at the chain that Jose thought they would
break it and run away. He jumped down, and,
in his effort to quiet the oxen, lost the chance
really to see the darting red machine. But he
saw other automobiles, by and by.</p>

<p>From the mill Antonio went to a neighboring
shop to buy the seeds he wanted for the second
crop planting. This took a long time. Just as he
came back, the sweet-toned bells of the cathedral
tower were chiming out one o'clock. He
guided the oxen to the end of a short side street,
where he let them graze upon the rich grass by
the road while he and Jose ate their luncheon.
Streams of water ran along in stone channels
by the roadside. The murmur of running water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
was heard everywhere and always, for this was
an especially dry season, and the gardens and
fields of Guimarães needed much moisture.</p>

<p>Back the brothers went with the oxen into the
city crowds. Antonio wanted to get some presents
to take home. Jose helped him choose
these. They bought a bright-colored little basket
for the mother, new silk kerchiefs for the
sisters, a gay little scarlet kerchief for Tareja,
and a book, about modern ways of farming, for
the father.</p>

<p>After this was done, Antonio was ready to go
home.</p>

<p>But Jose begged: "Please, oh please, Antonio,
let us stay till dark. The band keeps on
playing; I never should tire of hearing that.
And some boys were saying on the street as we
passed that there are going to be fireworks at
dusk."</p>

<p>Antonio hesitated. They were a long way
from home, and it had been a long day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Joanna will milk the cow, and feed the
chickens and pig. Mother will know we are
safe together. Do stay, Antonio."</p>

<p>So, because the little brother did not often
have a holiday, Antonio delayed starting for
home. The sky was very clear. A bright moon
would give them light on the way after the late
twilight ended.</p>

<p>There were many more people now in the
city square. The crowds were cheerful, rather
quiet, and very orderly; the Portuguese people
are sober-minded, even on their holidays.</p>

<p>Toward nightfall the scene grew gayer.
More bonfires were lighted. A second, third,
and fourth brass band marched through the
streets to their own lively strains of music.
Jose's quick ear caught many a tune which he
afterward played upon his violin. Candles were
lighted now on the shrines of the holiday saint.
The cathedral bells rang forth a beautiful vesper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
hymn. And almost before the sun had set,
the fireworks began.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 358px;">
<img src="images/i0104.jpg" width="358" height="500" alt="looking over city" />
<div class="caption">"HE AND JOSE LOOKED ACROSS THE CITY."</div>
</div>

<p>Antonio bought a bagful of buns and seed-cakes,
which they ate as they sat in the ox-cart
on the edge of the crowd. It was not long
before he saw that Jose was growing very
tired.</p>

<p>Antonio stepped down from the cart. "We
will start now, Jose. We can watch the fireworks
as we move away from the city. Then
we can stop outside and let the oxen feed a while.
They must be very hungry."</p>

<p>And because the big brother had been so kind,
Jose did not object now to the homeward start.</p>

<p>A half mile out in the country, just before
they reached the borders of the pine forest,
Antonio turned the willing oxen aside to let
them crop the thick grass. Seated on a high
rock, he and Jose looked across at the city.</p>

<p>Wonderful gleams of colored light&mdash;red,
blue, green and orange&mdash;shot out over the surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
valleys. Showers of bright stars fell,
it seemed, as if at their very feet. The tall
granite castle ruin was lighted up with a red
glow. The city itself, with its many towers and
tops showing in the blaze of color, with its
bursts of music which floated across on the soft
night air, was like a story or a dream.</p>

<p>At last Antonio turned the oxen to the road
again. "Truly we have had a wonderful end
to our holiday, Jose," he said.</p>

<p>"Truly we have," Jose replied drowsily. The
rest by the roadside had made him very sleepy,
and the glare of light had almost blinded his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Climb into the cart, Jose. There is no need
for two of us to walk. The road is growing
rougher now, and the cart jolts badly, but that
is easier to bear than going afoot."</p>

<p>Jose crept into the cart, and put his folded
jacket under his head for a pillow. He had
tight in his hand the paper bag with the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
seed-cakes he had saved for his sisters. A few
moments later he was fast asleep.</p>

<p>Antonio, without stopping the oxen who were
now going at top speed toward home, gently
put his cloak over the sleeping little man-brother.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<small>BETTER TIMES</small></h2>

<div class='poem'>
"In measureless content."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">&mdash;<i>William Shakespeare.</i></span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Better</span> times had surely come to the
Almaida family. By July, the father was able
to walk about without a cane; and the doctor,
whom Antonio asked to come again, said that
Senhor Almaida might begin work in September.</p>

<p>The first crops of the year were the largest
that the farm had ever raised. The early
harvest of oats, rye, and wheat was piled high
in the barn by the last of July, and the new
crops were growing abundantly.</p>

<p>"Another year we shall have twice as much
of everything," Jose said, as he sat with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
father and Antonio at the barn door in the
summer twilight.</p>

<p>The father looked smilingly into the little
boy's eager face as he answered: "Yes, and
we can keep two cows instead of one cow, and
more chickens, perhaps another pig. We shall
have more feed for them, and with our larger
crops to sell, we can soon pay back to Antonio
the money which he has spent for new farm
implements and tools. It was good for us all
that you went away, Antonio, and came back
with the new ideas."</p>

<p>There were other plans for the farm forming
in Antonio's mind, but he was not yet quite
ready to talk them over with his father.</p>

<p>A few days later, as Antonio and Jose finished
the work of watering the maize-fields for the
second time that day, by means of the oxen's
turning of the <i>nora</i>, Antonio said to Jose: "You
know there is the good full stream which flows
beyond the barn and along by the wood-lane?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
This autumn, when the farm-work grows
lighter, we will put in pipes from that stream
to the vineyard and garden, so that the crops can
be watered by what is called irrigation, and
without using the <i>nora</i>, which takes the oxen
away from the other work. We will not tell
this to the father until the time comes. He may
think it too large a thing for us to do."</p>

<p>In mid-August a party of students from
Coimbra University came strolling through the
village and up the hillside to the Almaidas' and
other farms. They were on a vacation pilgrimage
to Braga, one of the oldest cities in Portugal,
known in Roman times as <i>Baraca Augusta</i>,
and in more modern times as the home of the
royal Braganza family, to which King Manuel
II belonged.</p>

<p>While these students, in long black coats buttoned
close to the chin, ate the <i>brôa</i> and the
fresh fruits which the good mother set before
them, Jose asked them many questions about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
place from which they came. And they told the
little boy about Coimbra University, famous for
many centuries as the seat of learning for all
Portugal, and about the great buildings of the
University on the hill overlooking the town.</p>

<p>"Like the old castle of Guimarães?" Jose
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, have you ever seen that?" the leader
of the students asked.</p>

<p>Then Jose shyly described to them his holiday
with Antonio at Guimarães. "There is Antonio
off in the field now, and father is sitting with
him, in the shade."</p>

<p>The five students were very comfortable on
the vine-covered porch this warm August afternoon,
so they stayed a little longer, and told Jose
more about Coimbra,&mdash;how the city was, after
Guimarães, made the capital of Portugal, and
how, as the Christian kings, beginning with
Affonso Henriquez, drove the Moors farther
and farther south, until, after Coimbra, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
more southern city of Lisbon was made the
capital.</p>

<p>The students shook Jose's hand and clapped
him on the back as they started to go on with
their journey. "Some day I hope you will visit
Coimbra," one of them said.</p>

<p>"<i>Graçias, senhor</i>," Jose answered very
politely. "Some day I will go there, but not
yet, for I am only a little boy."</p>

<p>"You have seen and learned more than most
boys of your age in Portugal. I believe you
will some day come to study at Coimbra," the
leader of the students said.</p>

<p>"<i>Á deus, à deus</i>, boy; come to Coimbra some
day," the students cried as they went off; a
jolly, laughing group in their black coats.</p>

<p>Through the summer, talk of public reforms,
of railroad strikes, of riots and unrest, reached
the Almaida farm. It made the father think
with a half regret of the old days of quiet. It
made Antonio long for the time when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
young republic of Portugal would have passed
through these first months of change and become
settled.</p>

<p>But none of this talk disturbed Jose. He was
the happiest boy in all Portugal. His father
was nearly well. His big brother was going to
stay in Portugal. His mother grew brighter of
face every day. Joanna was soon to marry a
young village carpenter. Malfada and Jose
himself could go to school again in the autumn.
Little Tareja in a few years would also be able
to go. And every day Antonio told Jose stories
about the great world outside of Portugal.</p>

<p>Antonio valued education more than ever,
since his four years of life in America. He
knew that it was too late for him to go to school
again, because of his age and because of the
need for him to work on the farm. But he
talked with Jose of the future when, if the boy
turned out to be good at studies, he might go to
the University at Coimbra. And it happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in the years afterward, that Jose did go to
Coimbra, and that the leader of the students
who had stopped at the Almaida farm for brôa
and fruits on the August afternoon, was then a
teacher at Coimbra.</p>

<p>Of the money brought from America Antonio
had spent hardly any except that for farm tools
and implements. The rest of the money, a good
round sum for a young Portuguese farmer, was
in the bank at Guimarães. Once a month, now,
Antonio added a few dollars to this&mdash;not half
nor quarter as much as he might have had in
America, but although a man earns less in
Portugal, living costs less there.</p>

<p>With this money, and with what he would
add to it in the future, Antonio planned to pay
for Jose's education, and some time soon it
would make him able to build near his father's,
a new home where he could bring Inez Castillo
as his bride.</p>

<p>If Antonio and Jose have hot summers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
sixteen hours' work daily to toil through, they
have no great severity of winter weather to
bear. If their summer days bring more than
common heat and weariness, they find rest
during the cool, pleasant nights. In the summer
and winter evenings alike, father, mother and
children find quiet enjoyment together, and
always, best of all, they have the power to enjoy
simple things "in measureless content."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jose and Malfada, with many
other Portuguese children, are eagerly gaining
education in the bettered schools which are a
part of Portugal's new government.</p>
